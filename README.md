Update of Beasstmanns mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1342364585
based on the continuation by Guy

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md).**
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the new version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3497316713).
This version will not receive any further updates.

## Very large update!

Thanks to the excellent work of Delta this update brings alot of new animals to the mod.
These are from all around the Star Wars Galaxy. There are also added custom sounds and graphical variations.
If you have Vanilla Expanded Framework active, some animals have added behaviors regarding food and movement.
There are also added resources, like leathers, wool, meat, eggs and drugs; as well as skulls for trophies to collect.
Enjoy!
