**Very large update!**
Thanks to the excellent work of Delta this update brings alot of new animals to the mod.
These are from all around the Star Wars Galaxy. There are also added custom sounds and graphical variations.
If you have Vanilla Expanded Framework active, some animals have added behaviours regarding food and movement.
There are also added resources, like leathers, wool, meat and eggs, as well as skulls for trophies to collect.
Enjoy!
